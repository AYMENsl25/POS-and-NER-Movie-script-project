POS and NER Tagging on Movie Script Dataset
This project implements Part-of-Speech (POS) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tagging pipelines on a curated movie script dataset. It leverages classical models (HMM, CRF, Averaged Perceptron) and transformer-based architectures (BiLSTM, BERT) to benchmark tagging performance across different linguistic and semantic layers.

 Dataset
- Source: Parsed movie/TV script dialogue
- Format: Tokenized sentences with optional BIO-tagged labels
- Languages: English (multilingual support planned)
- Entities: PERSON, ORG, LOC, TIME, PRODUCT, etc.

 Models Used
Task   |  Classical Models     |Deep Learning  |Transformers   
POS    |  HMM, CRF,            |BiLSTM         |BERT (bert-base-cased)  
NER    |  MEMM,avg Perceptron  |BiGRU          |BERT (fine-tuned)
